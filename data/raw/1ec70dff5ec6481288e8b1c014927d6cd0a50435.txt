Starknet resumes block production after major outage following Grinta upgrade
Post-outage, Starknet's token suffers as team works to mitigate future disruptions with transparency and updates.
Starknet, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) scaling network, has resumed block production after a significant disruption halted activity for more than four hours.
In a Sept. 2 update on X, the team announced that “block production is back to normal,” confirming that most RPC providers are operating again while the remaining ones prepare to upgrade.
Starknet rolled back to block 1,960,612 to restore service, effectively removing about one hour of network activity. As a result, transactions submitted between 2:23 A.M. and 4:36 A.M. UTC were excluded from the chain and must be resubmitted.
The team pledged to publish a detailed post-mortem outlining the timeline, root cause, and plans to prevent similar incidents.
Before the fix was applied, the team told users it was investigating and working quickly to restore services.
Starknet remains one of the largest Layer 2 ecosystems despite the setback, securing around $550 million in assets, according to L2Beat data.
Meanwhile, the outage weighed heavily on market sentiment surrounding the blockchain network’s token.
According to CryptoSlate’s data, STRK lost 5% during the disruption and traded near $0.123 at press time.
Grinta update
The outage came less than 24 hours after Starknet deployed its “Grinta” upgrade, a release framed as a step toward decentralization and improved usability.
The upgrade (v0.14.0) introduced a three-node Tendermint consensus system to replace the single sequencer. While StarkWare still operates the new system, it is designed to evolve into a decentralized model soon.
The release also launched pre-confirmations, which assign a provisional status to transactions within half a second, creating near-instant feedback for users.
Starknet stated that the update makes block production run seven times faster than before, with additional speed improvements planned.
Grinta also brought a redesigned fee market inspired by Ethereum’s EIP-1559.
Under the new model, fees include base rates and optional tips across three categories, L1 gas, L2 gas, and L1 data gas. This structure is intended to balance network costs while keeping fees affordable, typically under three gFRI per L2 gas.
