Trump-linked WLFI token outpaces XRP in derivatives volume as traders face $30M losses
The new buyback proposal may shape WLFI's future amidst initial trading frenzy and sharp price dip.
World Liberty Financial’s WLFI token went live on Sept. 1 after months of anticipation, and the debut quickly turned heads across the crypto market.
According to CoinGlass data, WLFI’s derivatives activity surged past $13 billion within its first 24 hours, placing it behind only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.
Notably, that volume is almost double that of XRP, the third-largest crypto asset by market capitalization.
This highlights the level of speculative demand around the new Donald Trump-related digital asset.
Additionally, its spot trading volume during the period reached $4.7 billion, placing it among the top 10 most-traded digital assets.
Meanwhile, the intensity of the trading activities came at a cost as WLFI’s value slipped more than 14%, falling from about $0.33 to $0.24 as of press time.
CoinGlass data showed that this pullback triggered an estimated $30 million in trader losses.
WLFI’s buyback proposal
The launch coincided with a proposal from World Liberty Financial that could define WLFI’s long-term trajectory.
The team submitted a plan on Sept. 1 to use protocol-owned liquidity (POL) fees to buy back WLFI from the open market and permanently burn those tokens. Fees generated by independent liquidity providers would remain outside the program.
Under the proposal, POL fees from liquidity pools on Ethereum, BSC, and Solana would be collected and redirected to burn addresses, reducing circulating supply over time.
The project representatives said the initiative rewards committed holders by increasing their relative stake as speculative tokens are removed from circulation.
WLFI community members will soon vote on whether to approve the buyback-and-burn strategy or reject it in favor of keeping fees in the Treasury.
If approved, the measure would establish a framework for recurring supply reductions and could later expand to include other protocol revenue streams.
