Title:AWorld: Orchestrating the Training Recipe for Agentic AI
View PDFAbstract:The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node, sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.
