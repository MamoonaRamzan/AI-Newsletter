Title:Surveying the Operational Cybersecurity and Supply Chain Threat Landscape when Developing and Deploying AI Systems
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The rise of AI has transformed the software and hardware landscape, enabling powerful capabilities through specialized infrastructures, large-scale data storage, and advanced hardware. However, these innovations introduce unique attack surfaces and objectives which traditional cybersecurity assessments often overlook. Cyber attackers are shifting their objectives from conventional goals like privilege escalation and network pivoting to manipulating AI outputs to achieve desired system effects, such as slowing system performance, flooding outputs with false positives, or degrading model accuracy. This paper serves to raise awareness of the novel cyber threats that are introduced when incorporating AI into a software system. We explore the operational cybersecurity and supply chain risks across the AI lifecycle, emphasizing the need for tailored security frameworks to address evolving threats in the AI-driven landscape. We highlight previous exploitations and provide insights from working in this area. By understanding these risks, organizations can better protect AI systems and ensure their reliability and resilience.
