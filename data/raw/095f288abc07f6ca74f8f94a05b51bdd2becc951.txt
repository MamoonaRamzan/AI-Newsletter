Title:Navigating the EU AI Act: Foreseeable Challenges in Qualifying Deep Learning-Based Automated Inspections of Class III Medical Devices
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:As deep learning (DL) technologies advance, their application in automated visual inspection for Class III medical devices offers significant potential to enhance quality assurance and reduce human error. However, the adoption of such AI-based systems introduces new regulatory complexities--particularly under the EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, which imposes high-risk system obligations that differ in scope and depth from established regulatory frameworks such as the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the U.S. FDA Quality System Regulation (QSR). This paper presents a high-level technical assessment of the foresee-able challenges that manufacturers are likely to encounter when qualifying DL-based automated inspections within the existing medical device compliance landscape. It examines divergences in risk management principles, dataset governance, model validation, explainability requirements, and post-deployment monitoring obligations. The discussion also explores potential implementation strategies and highlights areas of uncertainty, including data retention burdens, global compliance implications, and the practical difficulties of achieving statistical significance in validation with limited defect data. Disclaimer: This publication is in-tended solely as an academic and technical evaluation. It is not a substitute for le-gal advice or official regulatory interpretation. The information presented here should not be relied upon to demonstrate compliance with the EU AI Act or any other statutory obligation. Manufacturers are encouraged to consult appropriate regulatory authorities and legal experts to determine specific compliance pathways.
