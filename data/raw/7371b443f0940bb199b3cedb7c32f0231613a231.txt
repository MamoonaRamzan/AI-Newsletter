Title:The Mathematician's Assistant: Integrating AI into Research Practice
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), marked by breakthroughs like 'AlphaEvolve' and 'Gemini Deep Think', is beginning to offer powerful new tools that have the potential to significantly alter the research practice in many areas of mathematics. This paper explores the current landscape of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) in a mathematical research context, based on developments up to August 2, 2025. Our analysis of recent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (BalunoviÄ‡ et al., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while state-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and evaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of self-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity.
Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI into the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented mathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical guidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding principles for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore seven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from creativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these principles translate into concrete practice.
We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than automation. This requires a new skill set focused on strategic prompting, critical verification, and methodological rigor in order to effectively use these powerful tools.
