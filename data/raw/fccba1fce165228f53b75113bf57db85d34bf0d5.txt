Title:AI reasoning effort mirrors human decision time on content moderation tasks
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant, suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.
