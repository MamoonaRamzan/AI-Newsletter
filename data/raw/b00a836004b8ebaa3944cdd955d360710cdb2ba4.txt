Even three years after its debut, with ever increasing competition in the AI image and video generation space, Midjourney, the bootstrapped San Francisco startup, remains the “gold standard” for its 20 million users — including atbVentureBeat, where we use it to generate the “header” art to many of our articles.
Apparently, the leaders of Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta feel similarly.
Today, Alexandr Wang, Scale AI founder and former CEO and now Meta’s chief AI officer and head of the newly formed Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), announced a partnership with Midjourney — believed to be the first of its kind for the independent AI image startup.
Meta will “license their aesthetic technology for our future models and products, bringing beauty to billions,” Wang wrote on X, a rival social network to Meta’s own Threads and Facebook.

Midjourney was previously reportedly in discussions with Elon Musk and xAI for some integration with the latter company’s Grok image generation capabilities, but xAI debuted Grok image generation powered by startup Black Forest Labs’ Flux AI image model, and now appears to have native image generation capabilities.
Two months ago, Midjourney added a capability that transforms images created on the site or uploaded by a user into artistic and captivating videos that has surpassed many users’ expectations.
Why Meta wants to partner with Midjourney
Wang framed the move as part of a bigger philosophy — Meta’s “all-of-the-above” approach to building advanced AI.
That means recruiting top research talent, pouring billions into computing infrastructure and, in this case, teaming up with a company whose work complements Meta’s in ways it can’t easily build on its own.
Midjourney, Wang said, has achieved “true feats of technical and aesthetic excellence,” and Meta is eager to put that expertise to work.
For Midjourney, the partnership is an opportunity to see its technology woven into one of the largest digital ecosystems on the planet.
But in his own X post, Midjourney founder David Holz was quick to stress what isn’t changing: The lab’s independence.
He reminded followers that Midjourney remains community-backed, has no outside investors and is still pursuing an ambitious slate of projects aimed at shaping what he calls more “humane futures.”
On paper, the tie-up makes sense. Meta brings scale, distribution and staggering compute power. Midjourney brings a creative edge, honed through years of training models to generate imagery that resonates with actual human tastes. It’s a marriage of brute force and design flair, an alliance that could help Meta’s AI systems feel less utilitarian and more inspired.
Details are lacking: How much $$$ is Midjourney getting from the partnership?
But for now, the details are hazy. Neither company has said how much the deal is worth.
There’s been no statements as to when Midjourney’s technology will start showing up in Meta’s products, or to what degree it will be baked into the company’s AI strategy.
Is this about upgrading the polish of Meta’s widely mocked and recently criticized chatbots — one of which a user allegedly mistook for a real person and died traveling to visit?
Will it be used to enhance Meta’s virtual reality (VR) worlds? Or supercharge creative tools across Instagram and Facebook? The answers remain vague for now.
Similarly, a big question concerns what will happen with Midjourney’s stated plans to pursue an external application programming interface (API) for other enterprises to build products and services atop of its powerful image generation models.
Last month, the official Midjourney account on X posted that it was “starting to investigate opening up an Enterprise API for people to start integrating Midjourney into their companies/services,” and provided an Enterprise API application questionnaire for interested parties.
That application remains online for now, but the question becomes whether a Meta-Midjourney inked deal is exclusive and will halt plans for a separate Midjourney API in its tracks. I messaged founder Holz and have asked about the API and will update upon receiving a response.
Massive AI shakeup at Meta
The announcement lands against the backdrop of Meta’s massive internal shake-up. In August, the company reorganized its AI operations, creating Meta Superintelligence Labs, with Wang — who joined after Meta’s $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI — at the helm.
The reorg split AI work into four core tracks: research, training, product and infrastructure.
Wang now oversees an elite bench of talent recruited from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind and beyond — recruited for eye-watering pay packages in the multi-hundred million dollar range — now tasked with pushing Meta toward its stated goal: personalized artificial superintelligence for each user.
It’s an ambitious mission, and a controversial one. Some researchers inside Meta are reportedly uneasy about the pace and scope of the changes. Others see Wang’s rapid consolidation of power as both necessary and risky. What’s clear is that Meta is betting heavily on AI as its future, and the Midjourney deal is one more sign of just how expansive that bet has become.
For Midjourney, aligning with Meta carries its own risks. Independence is central to its identity, and some in its community may worry that partnering with a tech giant could dilute that ethos.
Holz’s messaging suggests he knows this, which may explain why he emphasized Midjourney’s continued autonomy in the same breath as announcing the deal.
What happens next will depend on how the partnership translates from announcement to execution.
For now, the only certainty is that the ever-changing AI product landscape just took another big twist — and we’re all along for the ride.
