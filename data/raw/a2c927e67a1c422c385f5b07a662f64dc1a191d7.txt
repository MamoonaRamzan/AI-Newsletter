Title:Overview of BioASQ 2024: The twelfth BioASQ challenge on Large-Scale Biomedical Semantic Indexing and Question Answering
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This is an overview of the twelfth edition of the BioASQ challenge in the context of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2024. BioASQ is a series of international challenges promoting advances in large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering. This year, BioASQ consisted of new editions of the two established tasks b and Synergy, and two new tasks: a) MultiCardioNER on the adaptation of clinical entity detection to the cardiology domain in a multilingual setting, and b) BIONNE on nested NER in Russian and English. In this edition of BioASQ, 37 competing teams participated with more than 700 distinct submissions in total for the four different shared tasks of the challenge. Similarly to previous editions, most of the participating systems achieved competitive performance, suggesting the continuous advancement of the state-of-the-art in the field.
