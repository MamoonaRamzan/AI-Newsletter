Title:Is Artificial Intelligence Reshaping the Landscape of the International Academic Community of Geosciences?
View PDFAbstract:Through bibliometric analysis and topic modeling, we find that artificial intelligence (AI) is positively transforming geosciences research, with a notable increase in AI-related scientific output in recent years. We are encouraged to observe that earth scientists from developing countries have gained better visibility in the recent AI for Science (AI4S) paradigm and that AI is also improving the landscape of international collaboration in geoscience-related research.
